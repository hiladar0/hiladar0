### Projects
[**Rainfall prediction**](https://nbviewer.org/github/hiladar0/rainfall_prediction/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)
* A classifiction project, predicting next-day rainfall using seasonal time series data from different locations.
* Interesting aspects of the project include encoding wind direction in a continuous and periodic way, handling highly correlated features (morning vs afternoon values of the features), and developing a missing value imputation scheme that utilizes the autocorrelation of the features

[**Movie Recommendation System**](https://nbviewer.org/github/hiladar0/movie_recommendation_system/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)
* I implemented a recommendation algorithm to recommend movies for myself, using singular value decomposition. The training was done using MovieLens 20M dataset, and my recommendation was generated using personal rating from the IMDb app.


[**Covid-19 Pandemic Index as a Financial Factor**](https://nbviewer.org/github/hiladar0/normalcy_index/blob/main/corona_index.ipynb)
* I used 8 "normal-life" indicators that track how behavior has changed during the pandemic (e.g. office-use, flights tickets, sport attendance etc.) to construct a "normlacy" index, and compare it to changes in the S&P500 index.
* I was interested to test the hypothesis that a pandemic "normlacy" index can explain variations in stock market returns,  specifically if the Omicron variant can explain 2022 market drawdown.


[**Titanic Survival Prediction**](https://nbviewer.org/github/hiladar0/titanic/blob/main/TitanicProject.ipynb)
* My "Hello World" Data Scientist project, showcasing my skills in visualizing data, fitting models, hyperparameter optimization and performance analysis (top 10$% in the Kaggle competition)
